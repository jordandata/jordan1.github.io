## Machine Learning Projects

### 1. Classification

**Project 1 Description :** The goal of this problem was to utilize different classification techniques to determine whether the "area" column would be larger than 0. The main skills I would like to highlight my data analysis, cleaning, and manipulation skills. In addition to this I also utilized a number of different machine learning classification methods to determine which one is best based on accuracy and recall.

### 2. Image Classification

**Project 2 Description :** The goal of this problem was to create a model that could accurately classify the images that were presented to it. As seen below, the images are a cluster of pixles that resemble numbers. I utilized my visualization, machine learning, and data analysis skills and also did some work with simple neural networks to perform this image classification.

### 3. Neural Networks

**Project 3 Description :** The goal of this problem was to use neural networks to predict a value in a california housing data set. i utilized my visualization, machine learning, and data analysis skills as well as my work with artifical neural networks.

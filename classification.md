## Machine Learning Projects

### 1. Classification

**Project 1 Description :** The goal of this problem was to utilize different classification techniques to determine whether the "area" column would be larger than 0. The main skills I would like to highlight my data analysis, cleaning, and manipulation skills. In addition to this I also utilized a number of different machine learning classification methods to determine which one is best based on accuracy and recall.

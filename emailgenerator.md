# Project For Fun! The Email Generator
### Have you ever been faced with needing to send personalized emails to a large group of people? I wrote some code for just this problem.

### My girlfriend needed to send 100s of emails for her work, all which came from an excel sheet which contained first name, last name, and email address as seen below.

Hello [Personalized Name],

Please respond if you are coming to my cookout next Friday. 

Best,

Jordan
